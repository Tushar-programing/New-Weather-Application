# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is weather applicaiton built in React.js.
I use free weather api to get weather data from different city.
I use Search hints here when user search something. the search option dialog will be open.
But I use only 5000 option can show only. If I use above the 5000 so my Web app is start legging.
